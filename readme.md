LINSPECTOR
===========

Language Inspector (LINSPECTOR) is an effort to interpret the **multilingual** black box NLP models. With this work, we release an easy-to-use framework to help researchers,_especially the ones that are interested in world languages_, understand their word representations better. 

* We have created and released 15 probing tasks for 24 languages. 
    * If you only want to download the probing datasets, go to `intrinsic/data`
    * If you want to create your own probing tasks for other languages or with different settings, see [data_split/README](data_split/readme.md)
    * If you want to evaluate your new embeddings, or the intermediate representations extracted from a black box model, e.g., neural dependency parser, see the instructions in [intrinsic/evaluation/README](intrinsic/evaluation/readme.md)

* We have compiled and preprocessed (when necessary) dataset for universal part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, semantic role labeling, natural language inference and named entity recognition for Turkish, Finnish, German, Spanish and Russian. We provide the necessary data splits (when available) or guide you how to process the downloaded files with our preprocessing scripts.
    * If you want to evaluate your new embeddings on the downstream tasks, we provide config files that are ready to run with AllenNLP. 
    * Check [extrinsic/README](extrinsic/readme.md) for more details.
